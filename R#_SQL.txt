Q1.Query optimization steps and approaches:

1. Analyze the query

Use EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN ANALYZE or execution plan to see how the database executes it.

Identify full table scans, expensive joins, or sorts.

2. Rewrite the query

Replace correlated subqueries with joins or window functions if possible.

Remove unnecessary columns and tables.

Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries with large datasets.

3. Indexing

Add indexes on selective columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY.

Consider composite or covering indexes.

Avoid applying functions on indexed columns.

4. Partitioning and sharding

Split large tables by range, list, or hash to reduce scan size.

5. Use materialized views / temporary tables

Precompute aggregations or intermediate results.

6. Optimize joins

Use the correct join type (INNER, LEFT) and join order.

Ensure join columns are indexed.

7. Limit data early

Apply filters before joins or aggregations.

Use pagination (LIMIT, TOP) when fetching subsets.

8. Reduce network overhead

Fetch only required columns.

Avoid unnecessary client-side processing.

9. Monitor and tune

Check database statistics, update them if stale.

Measure before and after changes.

10. Database-specific features

Use query hints, optimizer directives, or parallel execution if supporte
