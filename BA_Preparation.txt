9. story Map :A story map (or user story map) is a visual planning tool used in 
Agile projects to organize user stories based on user activities and goals. It 
shows what users do, in what order, and which features deliver value first.

A RACI matrix is a responsibility assignment tool used to clearly define roles and responsibilities for tasks or deliverables in a project.

RACI Meaning

R – Responsible: Performs the work

A – Accountable: Owns the outcome and approves the work (only one per task)

C – Consulted: Provides input or expertise

I – Informed: Kept updated on progress
| Task                | BA | Dev | QA | PO |
| ------------------- | -- | --- | -- | -- |
| Gather requirements | R  | I   | I  | A  |
| Develop feature     | I  | R   | I  | A  |
| Testing             | I  | C   | R  | A  |

Scrum ceremonies are time-boxed events in Scrum that provide structure for planning, execution, review, and improvement of work in each sprint.

Time-box: Up to 8 hours for a 1-month sprint

2. Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)

Purpose: Synchronize team and plan next 24 hours

Focus:

Time-box: 15 minutes

3. Sprint Review

Purpose: Inspect the increment and gather feedback

Participants: Scrum Team + stakeholders

Output: Updated Product Backlog

back log refinement:
Backlog refinement (also called backlog grooming) is an ongoing activity, not an 
official Scrum ceremony, but it is critical for keeping the Product Backlog ready 
for future sprints.
When It Happens

Regularly during the sprint (typically once or twice per sprint)

Purpose

Break large items (epics) into smaller, actionable stories

Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria

Estimate effort for backlog items

Re-prioritize based on business value, dependencies, or new information
