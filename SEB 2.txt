Docker :
 docker container is wraps of piece of software in to single filesystem 
 that contains evyrthing that needs to be runa software. inlcuding libraries, 
 tool, dependecises
 ,
 
 How to deploy: Kubernates
 1in ur services, src file, generate docker file(steps of instruction to 
 create image)
 similar graddle file, YAML file.
 2. write manifest file(yaml file)
 
Sequential Steps to Deploy Microservices
Code Development & Build

Write and test microservice code in .NET Core.
Package dependencies and build artifacts.
Containerization

Create Docker images for each microservice.
Define Dockerfiles specifying runtime, dependencies, and environment variables.

Push to Container Registry

Push images to Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub for centralized storage.
Orchestration Setup

Use Kubernetes (AKS) or Docker Swarm for managing containers.
Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret).

CI/CD Pipeline

Configure Azure DevOps/Jenkins pipelines for automated build, test, and 
deployment.
Include stages for unit tests, security scans, and deployment to AKS.

Service Discovery & API Gateway

Implement API Gateway (e.g., Azure API Management or NGINX) for routing and load 
balancing.
Enable service discovery via Kubernetes DNS.

Monitoring & Logging

Integrate Splunk, AppDynamics, Prometheus, Grafana for health checks and 
performance monitoring.
Configure alerts for failures and anomalies.

Scaling & Updates

Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for scaling based on CPU/memory.
Deploy updates using rolling updates or blue-green deployments.

----------------
How do you handle failires in microsrvices
I handle failures using resilience patterns (Polly), Kubernetes health probes, 
centralized logging, and distributed tracing tools like OpenTelemetry to quickly 
identify and fix issues
Resilience Patterns:

Implement Circuit Breaker, Retry, and Timeout using libraries like Polly in .NET.

 Health Checks & Self-Healing:
 Centralized Logging & Monitoring:
 Alert logs
 -----------------------
 An API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests to multiple 
microservices. Instead of clients calling each microservice directly, they send 
requests to the gateway, which routes them to the appropriate service.
API Gateway is the single entry point for external clients.
It handles:

Authentication

Authorization

Routing

Rate limiting

Logging

Request/response transformation

Splitting the load
----------------
MS versioning
I version microservices using URI path versioning for simplicity and backward 
compatibility, and sometimes header-based versioning for flexibility
--------------------

 How do you test microservices?

Unit tests with xUnit/NUnit and mocks (Moq).
Integration tests using TestContainers/Docker Compose.
Contract tests with Pact to ensure API compatibility.
End-to-end tests with Postman or Selenium, automated in CI/CD.

 Handlers are classes that process these commands or queries.
 API handlers, event hanlders,messg handlers

 github actions
 CI CD tool
 Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
 
 a powerful continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform built 
directly into GitHub that allows you to automate software development workflows, 
such as building, testing, and deploying your code

Automating the work flows,
in github-Action s tab, you can see
in porject under SRC create work flow yaml files

itäs like weevr we pulll request automically deploys the code in test envoeronetn.
whne push our code to main branch- it should automaiclly deploys in production

when pull requets happens, we need to run the test cases, before it ll merge into 
main branch.

Azure moniotr:
Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring solution for collecting, analyzing, 
and responding to monitoring data from your cloud and on-premises environments. 
You can use Azure Monitor to maximize the availability and performance of your 
applications and services. It helps you understand how your applications are 
performing and allows you to manually and programmatically respond to system 
events.

Applicaiton isnights:
service used to monitor the performance, availability, and usage of live web 
applications
