JAva Script:
1.Q2. What is hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the scope during compilation. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

----------------
2.Explain closures.
A closure happens when an inner function remembers variables from
 its outer function even after the outer function has executed.
 It’s often used to keep data private or maintain state.
 It allows you to maintain state between function calls or hide private data.
 Closures are used for data privacy, function factories, and maintaining state (e.g., counters, caching results, event handlers).
 

---------------
3.Q4. How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations?
JavaScript is single-threaded but asynchronous behavior is achieved using:

Callbacks

Promises
Async tasks (API calls, timers) run outside the main thread,
 and results are pushed back when ready.
 .then

async/await
async function fetchData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
}
fetchData();
Concept	C#	JavaScript
Async keyword	Marks method returning Task	Marks function returning Promise
Await keyword	Waits for Task	Waits for Promise
Parallel tasks	Task.WhenAll()	Promise.all()
Thread model	Multi-threaded	Single-threaded (event loop)

key takeway :
Async operations prevent blocking of the main thread.
Use async/await for cleaner, synchronous-looking asynchronous code.

---------------------

What is Event loop, call stack,macro, micro tasks.

Event loop is like manager of tasks, it ll executes follows the tasks order
call stak is the actial worker which executes the tasks
micros task are like prioritize task, macro task normal taks.

----------------

-Q6. Difference between function declaration and arrow function
fucntion is tranditional 
this context.
arraow fucntion is like inline simple calcucaitons.
funtions:
greet("Bob"); 

function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
Arrow:
const double = (x) => x * 2;

// A standard arrow function with explicit return
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
  
------------------
What is prototype inheritance?
avaScript implements inheritance by using objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype.

Prototype inheritance enables method sharing and object extension without duplicating code.

----------
Q9. What are higher-order functions?

Explanation:
A higher-order function (HOF) either:

Takes one or more functions as arguments, or

Returns a function as a result.
------------------
What is destructuring and why use it?

Explanation:
Destructuring extracts values from arrays or objects into individual variables using a short syntax.
It improves readability and avoids repeated dot notation.
Destructuring makes data extraction from objects and arrays simpler, especially in API responses or parameter handling.

--------------------
async	Loads asynchronously, executes immediately	Random
defer	Loads asynchronously, executes after HTML parsed

----------------
API
How do you make HTTP requests using fetch or axios?

Explanation:
fetch() is a modern built-in browser API for sending HTTP requests.
axios is a third-party library with additional conveniences like automatic JSON parsing

---------------
how do you create objects in java script

var object
coma seperated, in between curely braces
object.create method()
object() method
or fucntion constructor

---------------

proto type chain
it like inheritance
inheriting the properties of particlu objetin ternal object link
Object.getPrototypeOf(person1)

-------------------
How to call API frm Java script
Fetch(),XMLHttpRequest,Axios
fetch('https://api.example.com/orders', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ itemId: 42, quantity: 3 })
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(result => console.log('Order created:', result))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
