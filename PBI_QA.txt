POWERBI:
Q5: What’s the difference between calculated columns and measures in Power BI?
Calculated Column:

Evaluated row by row when the data is loaded or refreshed.

Stored in the data model as part of the table.

Example:

Profit = Sales[SalesAmount] - Sales[Cost]


Each row gets its own Profit value.

Use when you need a value for each row or to create relationships.

Measure:

Calculated on the fly depending on the filter context (slicers, rows in a visual, etc.).

Not stored in the table; more memory-efficient.

Example:

Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Amount])


Calculates dynamically based on filters applied in your report.

Measures are preferred for KPIs and aggregations, as they update automatically with user interactions.

4.4. Visualizations & Storytelling

Q8: Which Power BI visuals would you use for different KPIs?

KPI Type	Visual Suggestions
Trend over time	Line Chart, Area Chart
Proportion / Share	Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Stacked Bar
Comparison of categories	Clustered Bar / Column Chart
Outliers / anomalies	Scatter Plot, Conditional Formatting
Single value / summary	Card, KPI Visual
------------------------------------

5.How do you make dashboards actionable?

Answer:

Include interactive filters (slicers): by region, product, or time.

Highlight KPIs with conditional formatting: e.g., revenue < target → red.

Combine multiple visuals to tell a story: trends + top products + low-performing regions.
---------------------
6.5. Performance & Best Practices

Q10: How do you handle large datasets in Power BI?

Use DirectQuery for live queries.

Aggregate data in SQL before importing.

Disable unnecessary auto-date tables.

Avoid complex calculated columns; prefer measures.

Use incremental refresh for tables with historical data.
--------------------
11.
Q11: How do you ensure your KPIs are accurate?

Validate SQL output before loading into Power BI.

Cross-check totals and trends.

Use test slices (e.g., region X, month Y) to ensure calculations match source.
'2. Implement Data Validation Checks

Add automated checks in SQL or ETL scripts before KPIs are calculated:

Row counts match source tables.

Totals make sense (e.g., total stock never exceeds inventory).

No negative or null values where they shouldn’t be.

If a check fails, trigger an alert (email/Teams message).
Maintain Historical Snapshots

Keep a daily snapshot of KPIs in a table.
-----------------
3. How do you handle large, frequently updated datasets?

Use incremental refresh with partitions by date.
Import only new and changed records.
Use aggregations for historical data and DirectQuery for live sections.
--------------------
4. What strategies ensure data accuracy across multiple sources?

Apply Power Query transformations for consistency.

Enforce data type alignment.

Create validation measures (e.g., sales = revenue ÷ price).

Use Dataflows for central cleansing.
