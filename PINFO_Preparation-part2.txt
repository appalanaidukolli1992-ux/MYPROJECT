Prompt:
keep in mind, if i'm preparing for senior db developer role,
and that database is quiet big db , multiple applicaitons used that db, having 
multiple schemas, and in bound out bound job that refreshes and sends data.JOb 
scheduled and runs through control-m.

Now explain what kind of quetions i may get MV, Sqeqeunces Pov

V$ views tables
v$ tables (also called Dynamic Performance Views) are real-time monitoring views maintained by the Oracle instance to show information about memory, processes, sessions, locks, I/O, SQL execution, optimizer behavior, and overall system health.

They are not normal schema tables—they are internal structures exposed as views.
1. What Are v$ Views?

They are dynamic views built on top of X$ structures (internal kernel tables).

They expose live runtime data from memory (SGA + background processes).

They are mostly read-only.

Most are session-dependent, meaning they show data relevant to the user’s current rights.

Examples:

v$session – live sessions

v$sql – SQL in shared pool

v$process – OS processes for Oracle

v$lock – locks

v$system_event – waits

v$undostat – undo statistics

v$log – redo log info

These are essential for real-time diagnostics.
5. Why Are v$ Views Important?

They support all real-time diagnostics:

Live wait events

Active sessions

Running SQL

Resource usage (CPU, I/O, temp, undo)

Locking/blocking

Background process state

Recovery status

Memory usage

Every performance tuning activity uses v$ views.

Examples:

Troubleshooting slow applications

Debugging batch failures

Identifying blocking sessions

Analyzing deadlocks

Investigating CPU spikes

Monitoring long-running SQL

RCA for ORA errors
.----------------------------------------------------

2. JOBS handling, RCAs,..

check the job logs, idneify root cause,
try to fix oracel errors, blocking sessiosn,
re run the job

3 .Materilzed views:

A materialized view is a database object that stores the results of a 
query physically on disk. It behaves like a table that is generated from 
a query, and it can be refreshed to stay in sync with the underlying data.


1. Purpose

Improve performance for heavy, expensive queries (joins, aggregations).

Cache precomputed results so the database doesn’t rerun the full query each time.
----------------

4. Sequences_:
A sequence is a database object that generates a series of numeric values, 

typically used for primary keys or any place you need unique, incremental
 numbers.


Core characteristics:

1. Independent object
A sequence is not tied to a table. Multiple tables or processes can use the same
 sequence if needed.

----------------
1. MV refresh takes 2 hours instead of 20 minutes. How to diagnose?

Check source-table data growth and skew.

Examine execution plan changes due to updated statistics.

Check blocking/locking during refresh.

Verify MV logs (if incremental) for excessive changes.

Review I/O pressure or degraded storage performance.

Compare refresh method (FAST vs COMPLETE) to expected behavior.
---------------------
2. Two dependent MVs must refresh in sequence, but Control-M triggers them
 in parallel. Solution?

Add job dependency rules in Control-M (Job B “On-OK” Job A).

Implement an internal DB lock/table-based semaphore to serialize refreshes.

Combine refresh into a single stored procedure that Control-M runs once.

Use DB scheduling constraints to enforce order if Control-M cannot.
