My name is Appala Naidu Kolli. I currently work as an IT Business Analyst in the 
GS1 traceability and compliance program at IKEA Supply Chain Development, where 
I’m engaged as a consultant from TCS. I have been working with IKEA for almost 
nine years across different units—INGKA, Inter IKEA Range, and now Supply. This 
is my fourth assignment within the IKEA ecosystem.

I started my career in 2017 as an Application Support Analyst and progressed into 
an AMS Lead role, managing over 40+ core Range business applications. My 
responsibilities covered end-to-end application lifecycle operations, including 
incident and problem management, release and deployment coordination, root-cause 
analysis, functional and technical testing, and SLA governance. I also acted as a 
stakeholder contact point, ensured operational stability, and led 
cross-functional collaboration. Over time, I became a subject matter expert, 
coached teams, and contributed to process improvements and automation initiatives.

In 2023, I transitioned into Supply Chain Development as an IT Business Analyst. 
My work focuses on traceability, data quality, and GS1 standards adoption across 
Range and Supply. I support business exploration, requirements analysis, and 
compliance readiness—especially around sustainability and trade regulations such 
as EUDR, CBAM, and Digital Product Passport. I prepare case studies, analyse 
business and technical gaps, create structured findings and recommendations, and 
translate business needs into digital product requirements. I also work with data 
analysis, visualization, and stakeholder alignment to enable value-driven 
decision-making. and we have POC team where there i help them on creating
 user storeis collecting the requiremtns
writing acceptance criteris, verifications, assitign developers to understand the 
business process, clarifications, guding them to understand business rules, logics


Overall, I bring a mix of business analysis, technical understanding, supply 
chain knowledge, and strong experience within IKEA ways of working. I enjoy 
solving complex problems, working with diverse teams, and contributing to 
scalable, future-ready solutions

What u bring into this team?
I bring a strong blend of business and technical expertise, with deep knowledge 
of IKEA business processes, compliance, traceability, and legislation. I have 
experience translating complex business requirements into actionable digital 
solutions, supporting end-to-end supply chain improvements.

I also bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, a structured way of 
working, and the ability to collaborate effectively across global, 
cross-functional teams. Beyond technical skills, I contribute by sharing 
knowledge, mentoring colleagues, and helping the team continuously learn and 
improve.

In short, I bring both the expertise and the mindset to deliver value, support 
innovation, and strengthen the team’s impact within IKEA.

-------------------
	1. What do you feel are the qualities of an effective team?
I think an effective team reflects H&M’s values — being one team, believing in 
people, and always improving. For me, teamwork means trusting and supporting each 
other, communicating openly, and working toward the same goal. I also believe in 
creating space for new ideas and continuous improvement, because that’s how teams 
grow and deliver great results together.

--------
When someone contradicts me, I first listen carefully to understand their point 
of view. Then I explain my perspective clearly, using facts, data, or examples to 
support it. I focus on showing the benefits of my approach rather than forcing my 
opinion.

I also try to find common ground and involve them in discussion, so we reach a 
solution that works for both sides. My goal is to influence decisions positively 
while keeping the conversation respectful and collaborative
