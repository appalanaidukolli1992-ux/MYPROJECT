We are looking for people with 

Minimum 3 years of experience in a data-driven role within supply chain operations, ideally in overstock handling, returns management, or circular fashion initiatives.
Proven hands-on experience with SQL for querying large datasets, and Power BI for building dashboards and visualizing KPIs. Experience with Python or other programming language for automation, C# for application logic, and JavaScript for web-application development is needed.
Experience with Power Automate for workflow optimization is a strong plus.
Some experience from working with Cloud Platforms and maintaining web-based applications, especially in the context of internal business applications and data pipelines


And people who are

Strong communicators and storytellers with the skills and ability to communicate and explain data and its implications to various different stakeholders. 
Curious and take the initiative, driven to explore new ideas, ask questions, and take ownership from start to finish 
Based in Stockholm and able to commute to the office 4 days/week (no relocation support).
