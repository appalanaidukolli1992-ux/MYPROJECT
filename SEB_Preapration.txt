1. Cluster

A group of machines (nodes) managed by Kubernetes.
Think: Your whole environment.

2. Node

A single machine (VM or physical) inside the cluster.
Think: Like your Windows server, but usually Linux.

3. Pod

The smallest running unit. Contains one or more containers.
Think: A small box running your app.

4. Container

Your application packaged with everything it needs.
Think: Your app + runtime inside a mini environment.


-- dockarizarion:
creating docker image for your applciaiton
Including all required dependencies (runtime, libraries, configs)
Running that image as a container
Instead of installing .NET, Node.js, IIS, libraries, configs manually on a server,
you put everything your application needs inside a single portable box.

That box = Docker container.
------------------------

Devops Steps:

Developer writes code locally.

git add + git commit → saves snapshot locally.

git push → sends code to GitHub (remote repo).

Jenkins detects changes in GitHub (via webhook).

Jenkins pulls the code, builds it, runs tests.

If everything passes, Jenkins deploys to server (Windows/IIS in your case).

-----------------

GIt, github
Add → Commit → Push → Pull

Add → staging

Commit → snapshot

Push → publish

Pull → update


------------
Commands:
git init

Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder.

Example: git init
git clone <repo_url>

Copy a remote GitHub repository to your local machine.

Example: git clone https://github.com/user/project.git

git status

Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

Example: git status
git add <file> or git add .

Stage changes to prepare them for commit.

Example: git add index.js or git add . (all files)
git commit -m "message"

Save a snapshot of staged changes with a message.

Example: git commit -m "Fixed login bug"
git log

View the history of commits.

Example: git log

microservices
Microservices is an architecture where the application is split into small, 
independent services, each owning a single business capability and its own 
database. Services communicate through APIs or messaging and can be built, 
deployed, and scaled independently. This improves scalability, resilience, and 
delivery speed, but requires good DevOps, monitoring, and careful handling of 
distributed communication

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is built as a 
collection of small, independent services, each responsible for a specific 
business capability.
Each service runs independently, has its own codebase, its own database (or data 
store), and communicates with other services using APIs or messaging

benefits:
indepedently operatable, deployable, maintaible, techology independetn,scalable.one fails other still works
e.commerce, payment daila salso, othr ucntonaoties works'

How thy communciate :
Synchronous (API calls)

REST, gRPC between services.

Asynchronous (Messaging)

Using Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus.

Enables loose coupling.
-------------------------
2. How do you handle authentication between microservices?
Answer

Use token-based authentication, usually JWT, issued by a central identity 
provider (Azure AD, Identity Server, Auth0).
Each service validates the token using its public key.

Example

Client authenticates with Identity Provider and receives JWT.

Client calls API Gateway → JWT forwarded to microservices.

Services verify token signature + roles + permissions before processing.
-----------------
Authenrization

JWT token contains signature, claim, and roles/permsision swill be encoded in it, 
based the rolescleint will autherize and allow to use the particular reosurse.
--------------
Security:
API Gateway
Http, JWT authention, Secrets stored in azure keyvaluot, or endocded format

All microservices access DB connection strings from Azure Key Vault.

Every service uses HTTPS + certificate pinning.

Gateway applies rate limiting to public APIs: 1000 req/min per user.

8. How do you deploy microservices?
Explanation

Microservices are packaged as Docker images and managed by Kubernetes.
Kubernetes provides:

Auto-scaling

Self-healing

Load balancing

Config management

Example

Order Service:

Build Docker image → Push to registry → Kubernetes deploys 5 replicas

Inventory Service only needs 2 replicas → separate scaling

---------------------------
Kuberbates nutshell:
open source orchastration platform
cluster is gourp os nodes to run containerized applciaitons
Cluster-worker nodes- Node-Pod-container
Control plane is UI pane, to managing the cluster
controller manager, scheduler,
PODs-smallest deployable units inK8s


Docker
next level of VMs
1 os multiples apps can be runs, more space saving
app code->Image->Resgistery(server/where application runs)-> containers starts

each docker will have multiple containers

When we want to deal / manages with 100s of containers in , then there kunbernates K8s comes
 it ll manage orchastarte u r containers
 you ll give instructions to it, like
 this is how my containers shud works, in my clusters 
 it handles computes, load balnacing,delete, balcnes, starts,schedulde, scalling,
