Relationship PBI understadn:
Absolutely! Let me break this down step by step in a very beginner-friendly way.

Even though your database tables already have relationships (foreign keys, etc.), **Power BI does not automatically know them when you import tables**. You need to **define relationships in the Power BI data model** so that it can correctly filter, aggregate, and calculate measures across tables.

## **Why You Need Relationships in Power BI**

1. **Separate fact & dimension tables:**

   * Your **fact table** is `KPI_InventorySnapshot` (daily KPIs for each SKU).
   * Your **dimension tables** are SKU, Category, Supplier, Region.

   Power BI needs to know how these tables are linked so slicers, filters, and visuals work correctly.

2. **Filtering and aggregation:**

   * Example: If you select a Region in a slicer, Power BI should automatically show KPIs **only for SKUs in that region**.
   * Relationships tell Power BI which fields connect the tables.

3. **Power BI relationships can be “one-to-many” or “many-to-one”:**

   * Fact table → Many rows per SKU per day
   * Dimension table → One row per SKU or Category

## **Step 1: Open Model View**

1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click on the **Model view** icon on the left (it looks like a diagram).
3. You’ll see all imported tables as boxes.

## **Step 2: Create Relationships**

1. Identify the **key fields** you want to join:

| Fact Table (KPI_InventorySnapshot) | Dimension Table      | Relationship Type |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| sku_id                             | SKU.sku_id           | Many-to-One       |
| SKU.category_id                    | Category.category_id | Many-to-One       |
| SKU.supplier_id                    | Supplier.supplier_id | Many-to-One       |
| SKU.region_id                      | Region.region_id     | Many-to-One       |

2. Drag the field from one table to the corresponding field in the other table.

   * Example: drag `KPI_InventorySnapshot.sku_id` → `SKU.sku_id`.

3. Power BI will automatically create a **line between the tables**.

## **Step 3: Check & Configure the Relationship**

1. Double-click the relationship line → relationship properties appear.
2. Ensure:

   * **Cardinality:** `Many to One ( *:1 )`
   * **Cross filter direction:** Usually **Single** from dimension → fact table
   * **Apply security filter in both directions:** Leave unchecked unless needed

> **Tip:** Dimension tables are usually the “one” side, fact table is the “many” side.

## **Step 4: Test Your Relationships**

* Go back to **Report view**.
* Create a table visual: put **Region** from the dimension table and **Total Overstock SKUs** from the fact table.
* If the numbers change correctly when you filter by Region, your relationships are correct.

## **Important Notes**

1. **Relationships in Power BI are for reporting purposes only** — they do not affect your source database.
2. Even if your database has foreign keys, Power BI **needs its own relationships** to correctly join tables for visuals and DAX calculations.
3. Always connect **fact table → dimension tables**; do not connect dimension tables directly to each other unless necessary.

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram showing the correct relationships between your KPI snapshot and dimension tables** so you can visually see how to link them in Power BI.

Do you want me to do that?
