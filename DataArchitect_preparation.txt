Data architect:
A data product is a purpose-built, business-focused dataset or data service that 
is created on top of a modern data platform. It uses data from multiple sources, 
applies defined business rules and transformations, and delivers trusted, 
well-governed information to specific consumers.

A data product is not the entire data warehouse or lake. Instead, it is a curated 
output of the platform that represents a single source of truth for a specific 
business domain or use case.

It includes:

Clean, well-modeled data

Business definitions and rules

Technical and business metadata

Data quality checks and governance

Clear ownership and accountability

A data product is designed so that consumer applications and business teams can 
easily understand what the data represents, trust its accuracy, and use it 
without needing deep technical knowledge of the underlying systems.

It can be consumed in flexible ways such as:

SQL tables or views

APIs

Scheduled jobs

Reports and dashboards

Data pipelines feeding downstream systems

In short, a modern data platform enables data products, and a data product is a 
reliable, reusable, and consumer-ready data asset that delivers business value.

A data product is not a single tool. It is built using a stack of technologies 
across ingestion, storage, processing, governance, and consumption, all operating 
on a modern data platform.
