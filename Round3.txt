SQL & NAlaytical :
1.Walk me through a time you explored raw messy supply
 chain data and identified a meaningful business insight.
 

2. How do you structure SQL to analyze millions of records and
 not crash the database?”
 I avoid heavy operations directly on full tables. I structure analysis using these principles:

• Filter early — apply WHERE conditions before any joins. I never join the whole dataset. I start by limiting to relevant date range, product category, region, etc.
• Use CTEs or temporary tables — break analysis into lightweight steps, not one massive query. Each stage reduces volume.
• Select only required columns — no SELECT *. This directly reduces memory footprint.
• Index awareness — for frequently filtered or joined columns, I check if indexes exist. If not, I request/index where justified.
• Aggregate late — only calculate sums, groupings, or window functions after volume is reduced.
• Avoid Cartesian joins — always use explicit join conditions with proper keys.
• Pagination or batch execution if needed — when exporting or processing multiple years.


-- STEP 1: Narrow down first instead of touching full 40M
WITH recent_inventory AS (
    SELECT sku_id, location_id, quantity, last_movement_date
    FROM inventory
    WHERE last_movement_date >= DATEADD(day, -180, GETDATE())   -- filter early
),
-- STEP 2: Only select SKUs with any stocks > 0
filtered_active AS (
    SELECT sku_id, location_id, quantity, last_movement_date
    FROM recent_inventory
    WHERE quantity > 0
),
-- STEP 3: Now apply no-movement logic
no_movement AS (
    SELECT sku_id, location_id, quantity,
           DATEDIFF(day, last_movement_date, GETDATE()) AS days_idle
    FROM filtered_active
    WHERE last_movement_date <= DATEADD(day, -90, GETDATE())   -- final logic
)

SELECT sku_id, location_id, quantity, days_idle
FROM no_movement
ORDER BY days_idle DESC;

-- 1) Filter last 180 days only, avoid full historical scan

            WHEN sold_qty = 0 THEN 0
            ELSE (CAST(returned_qty AS FLOAT) / sold_qty)
        END AS return_rate,

        CASE

Answer structure: Context → Approach → Insight → Impact

Example answer:

“In a previous project, I needed to identify inventory that was blocking warehouse capacity or creating cost issues. The dataset included millions of records with stock levels, sales, returns, and last movement dates.

I approached it by first filtering to recent activity to avoid overwhelming the database. Then, I calculated key metrics per SKU:

Overstock flag for SKUs exceeding safety stock thresholds

Slow-moving flag for SKUs with no sales in 90 days

Return rate to see items frequently returned

Stock age to see how long items have been idle

Next, I combined these KPIs to segment inventory into meaningful buckets:

Critical idle (overstock + slow-moving + aged)

Overstock but moving

Slow-moving

Healthy stock

This allowed stakeholders to focus on the 12–15% of SKUs that were consuming over 50% of warehouse volume. The insight directly supported actions like external resale, markdowns, or recycling, freeing space and reducing holding cost.

I would present this through dashboards so the team could track KPIs dynamically by region, supplier, and category.”

Key points to convey:

You understand data structure and scale.

You translate raw data into business-relevant insights.

You focus on impact and action, not just numbers.

You can explain it clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

3 If I ask you to find dead/no-moving stock — how would you approach it? Not just SQL query, but logic, starting assumptions, KPI definition.”

4 If overstock is high in one region — what questions do you ask next before presenting anything?”
