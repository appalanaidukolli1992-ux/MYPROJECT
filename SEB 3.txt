ACID is an acronym for four key properties of database transactions: Atomicity, 
Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These principles ensure that database 
operations are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity and reliability, 
even in the event of system failures or concurrent access

Atomicity : until entire trasactions compltes no chnages are saved permenealy
consistancy: you cannot break the predefined rules, for exmaple bank balance should nto in neegetive,
if u r trying entire u r operations stopsand rolles back.
isolation : even though mulitple concurrent transaction happenign on tables, 
it ll be handled in sequenticla way.
Durability : once commit changes, it ll stored in non-volatile storega estores perminetly.

-------------------
Mongo DB
IDE : mongo DB compass
document based database
data is saved documeted format, in Bson Bitjson

tables-collections
create syntax. ->db.users.insertone({name :"John"})
select qiery : -> db.users.find()
we use .agrregate for joins, relations
refrencing(normal) : we use $lookup,$group kind of 
embedding(denormal) : inside same query inlcude all attirbutes.

--------- Overal application security, authencittion, autherizarion.--
Authentication & Authorization

Use OAuth2 / OpenID Connect with centralized Identity Provider
(Azure AD, Auth0, Keycloak, IdentityServer).

All requests validated using JWT tokens.

Use role-based and policy-based authorization in APIs.

2. API Security

Enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere.
Add rate limiting and IP restrictions at API Gateway.
Use input validation, model validation, and anti-CSRF tokens.

3. Secure DevOps / CI-CD (DevSecOps)

Static code analysis → SonarQube, Snyk

Dependency scanning → GitHub Dependabot

Secrets scanning → GitHub Secret Scanner

Vulnerability checks before deployment

Block production deployment on security failures

4. Secrets Management

Never store passwords or secrets in:

code

config files

GitHub

Use:

Azure Key Vault

Kubernetes Secrets

AWS Parameter Store

..
CORS is the mechanism that allows one website to get data from a different 
website only if the second website explicitly permits it. Without it, almost all 
modern web interactions would be impossible due to security restrictions.

4.Secure Configuration & Hardening

Disable unnecessary ports

Use CORS properly

Set secure headers

Follow least privilege for service accounts
..
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a crucial security protocol that creates a 
private, encrypted channel for communication over the internet. It's the "S" in 
HTTPS, ensuring that data transferred between your browser (the client) and a 
website's server cannot be eavesdropped on, tampered with, or forged by third 
parties
..
6. Data Protection

Encrypt data in-transit (TLS)

Encrypt data at-rest (Azure SQL TDE, MongoDB encryption)

Mask sensitive fields in logs
SQL Injection protection via parameterized queries
8
API Gateway + Firewall Protection

Use WAF (Azure Application Gateway WAF)

Block malicious IPs

Add rate limiting and throttling

Example:

Only allow 100 calls per minute per user

Vulnarable scans in docker images or in CI CD pipless, 
-------------------------------------------

. Logging, Monitoring & Intrusion Detection

Centralized logging (ELK, Azure Monitor)

Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)

Alerting for unusual behavior (failed logins, spikes)

I follow a layered security approach. Authentication and authorization use 
OAuth2/OIDC with JWT tokens. APIs run over HTTPS, protected with rate limiting 
and secure headers. Secrets are stored in Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes Secrets, 
never in code. I enforce secure coding (validation, parameterized queries), 
dependency scanning, static analysis, and image scanning in CI/CD. Databases are 
encrypted and access is least-privilege. API Gateway and WAF add additional 
protection. Logging and monitoring systems detect security events. Overall, I 
apply DevSecOps practices throughout development, build, and deployment

Common attacks & prevention actions
1. DDoS / API Flooding Attack
What happens

Attackers flood your API or microservices with millions of requests to:

Crash services

Exhaust CPU, memory, network

How to handle

Rate limiting (API Gateway)

Throttling

Autoscaling

WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Bot protection
API Gateway rule:

Allow max 100 requests per minute per IP

2. Authentication/Authorization Attacks
Brute force attcks-- taril and errror trying idffer uid,pwds
token thefting --  involves an attacker stealing an active user's authentication token to bypass the login process entirely.
 using malware, sinfiing,xss cross sote scripting
session hijacking-- taken contrl of seeesion

account lock aftr certain limitin
captha uathentice
MFA
Oauth-jwt
short lived tokens,refreshtokens

3. SQL Injection
What happens

Attacker injects SQL to read or modify DB.

How to handle

Parameterized queries

ORM frameworks Use ORM like Mongoose or EFCore

Input validation
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Attack

Injects malicious JavaScript into UI.

Prevent

Escape HTML in UI

Input sanitization

Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

-------------------

We use Azure App Services to host our .NET APIs. Azure Key Vault is used for 
secure storage of secrets and certificates. Azure API Management acts as our API 
gateway for routing, throttling, authentication, and request handling. For CI/CD, 
we use GitHub Actions to build the code, run tests, generate artifacts, and 
deploy to the Azure environment. For monitoring, we rely on Azure Monitor and 
Application Insights for centralized logging, performance metrics, and alerting
