1. Core Angular Topics
Master the essentials and some intermediate/advanced concepts:

Components, Modules, Services


Data Binding (1-way, 2-way), Event handling

Routing and Navigation (+ route guards)

Forms (Template-driven and Reactive)

Pipes (built-in and custom)

Directives (structural & attribute)

Dependency Injection

Observables and RxJS basics

Angular Lifecycle Hooks

HTTP Client (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

Error handling and Interceptors

Lazy Loading, Feature Modules

Unit Testing (basic concepts)
. .NET Backend Essentials
Understand how the backend works and integrates with Angular:

C# Basics (OOP, LINQ, Collections)

ASP.NET Core Web API

Controllers, routing

Dependency Injection

Attribute-based routing --attrtibute on controller instead central routing it ll 
take attirbutes idrectky from url and sends ot method

Model Binding & Validation--Model Binding (Simple Explanation)

Model Binding in ASP.NET Core automatically converts incoming HTTP request data
(JSON, query string, route values, form data)
into C# objects, so you don’t manually parse anything.

JWT Authentication / Authorization

--Entity Framework Core (Code-first, Migrations, LINQ)

EF Core is a lightweight, modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET.

It allows you to work with a database using C# objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

Supports LINQ queries, change tracking, migrations, and more.

--Repository Pattern
-- Middleware and Logging
Middleware is software that sits in the HTTP request pipeline and can process 
requests and responses.

Think of it as a series of steps that every request goes through before reaching 
your controller, and every response goes through before 
returning to the client.

Examples: authentication, authorization, logging, exception handling, CORS, compression.


--Error Handling and HTTP status codes
Code	Meaning	Example Usage
200 OK	Request succeeded	Returning a list of items
201 Created	Resource successfully created	After a POST request creating a new record
204 No Content	Request succeeded but no content to return	DELETE request successful
400 Bad Request	Client sent invalid data	Invalid JSON or missing required fields
401 Unauthorized	Authentication required / failed	User not logged in or invalid token
403 Forbidden	Authenticated but not allowed	User doesn’t have permission
404 Not Found	Resource does not exist	Requested item ID not found
500 Internal Server Error

globale error handlers in middelware
Describe it as “a centralized place to catch all unhandled errors, log them, and return a consistent response”.

Mention it improves maintainability and security, as raw exceptions are not exposed to the client.
How:Middleware intercepts the request before it reaches the controller.

The middleware wraps the request pipeline in a try-catch.

If any exception occurs:

Logs the exception.

Sets the appropriate HTTP status code.

Returns a structured error response to the client.


✅ 3. Integration Topics (Frontend + Backend)
You must know how Angular and .NET Core work together:

Calling .NET APIs from Angular using HttpClient

Handling JSON responses

CORS setup in ASP.NET Core

Token-based authentication with Angular + .NET (JWT)

Uploading files

Securing routes in Angular based on backend roles/claims

✅ 4. SQL & Database
Writing SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, INSERT, etc.)

Basic understanding of stored procedures and indexing

EF Core query translation to SQL

✅ 5. Project/Application Knowledge
Be ready to explain:

What project you built (end-to-end flow)

Tech stack and architecture

Challenges you faced & how you solved them

How frontend talks to backend (API endpoints, services)

Any authentication/authorization implementation

Your role: what exactly you did (coding, designing, testing)

✅ 6. Soft Skills & Mindset
Problem-solving approach

Willingness to learn & adapt

Team collaboration

Understanding of Agile/Scrum

Communication skills (clear, structured answers)
