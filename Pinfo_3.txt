PINFO part 3

1-Data modelling:
Data modelling is Data modeling is the process of creating a visual blueprint of 
how data is organized and related within a system

It involves defining the types of data, their attributes,
 and the relationships between them, often using diagrams and symbols
 ---------
 
 3 levels of modelling
 conceptual, logical,physical
 -----------------
 
 Constarints:
Summary Table
Constraint Type	Purpose	Example
NOT NULL	Prevents NULL values	Mandatory columns
UNIQUE	No duplicate values	Email, username
PRIMARY KEY	Unique identifier	emp_id
FOREIGN KEY	Parent-child relationships	dept_id → departments
CHECK	Validates rules	salary > 0
DEFAULT	Sets auto-value	default status
DEFERRABLE	Delay validation	ETL/batch ops
---------------------------

3. Normalizarion:
Normalization is a database design process applied to SQL and thus
to the underlying Oracle database schema.
Normal Forms (NF)
Normalization is achieved by adhering to a set of rules called Normal Forms. 
A database schema is typically considered "normalized" if it meets the
 requirements of the Third Normal Form (3NF).
------------
 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
A table is in 1NF if:

Each column contains only atomic (single, indivisible) values.

There are no repeating groups of columns.

Each row is unique (i.e., it has a Primary Key).

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
A table is in 2NF if:

It is already in 1NF.


All non-key attributes (columns not part of the primary key) are fully 
functionally dependent on the entire Primary Key. This rule applies primarily 
when a table has a composite primary key (a key made of two or more columns).
It eliminates partial dependencies.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
A table is in 3NF if:

It is already in 2NF.

Removing trasnitive depedenices

There are no transitive dependencies. A transitive dependency exists when
 a non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute. The rule ensures 
all non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

---
Higher Normal Forms
The forms beyond BCNF are typically used only in highly specific, complex,
 and theoretical database scenarios.

Fourth Normal Form (4NF): A table is in 4NF if it is in BCNF and has no
 multi-valued dependencies
 (where two or more independent attributes depend on the key).

Fifth Normal Form (5NF): Also known as Project-Join Normal Form (PJ/NF).
 It eliminates join dependencies by ensuring that the table cannot be 
 non-loss decomposed into any number of smaller tables.

Sixth Normal Form (6NF): A very specialized form used for temporal databases
 (databases that track changes over time).

------------

Table databse design
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) or a Relational Model Diagram
stpes :
**Concise version**

1. **Gather requirements**

   * Identify core business entities, relationships, and rules from use cases and APIs.

2. **Model the domain**

   * Create a conceptual/logical ERD with entities, attributes, keys, and cardinalities.
   * Apply 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to eliminate redundancy and dependency issues.

3. **Design Oracle schema**

   * Group tables by domain (e.g., ORDER_MGMT, CUSTOMER_MDM).
   * For each table: choose proper data types, define PKs, FKs, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK), and deletion rules.

4. **Implement relationships**

   * Use FKs for 1–N.
   * Use junction tables for M–N.
   * Use lookup tables for codes and statuses.

5. **Optimize physical design**

   * Add necessary indexes (PKs, FKs, filter columns).
   * Consider partitioning and naming standards.
   * Centralize logic in SQL/PLSQL and avoid row-by-row operations.

6. **Support versioning and enhancements**

   * Analyze iimpact on existing ERD.
   * Add tables/columns without breaking backward compatibility.
   * Favor additive changes and use views/synonyms/APIs to insulate consumers.

Questions from the interview
1. what are other kind of architectures we have in API dot net
layered arcuhtetite, --simple crud operations
clean architectire-- complex business logic
verticla slice
CQRS Command Query Responsibility Segregation
Minimal API
microservices architectire -- large distributes sustesm


2. dot net version, whihc version you have used?
dotnet 10
API.csproj file

3. how did you handle validations, which layers you handled the validaitons and how?
----------------------
4. if you need to take this into production , what other stpes will you take?

Summary Priority List
Must Implement (Critical):
1.	Comprehensive logging (Serilog + Application Insights)
2.	Health checks
3.	Rate limiting
4.	Secrets management
5.	Database resilience
6.	Global exception handling (already have)
Should Implement (High Priority): 7. Response caching 8. API versioning 9.
 Correlation IDs 10. Request/response logging 11. Background jobs
Nice to Have (Medium Priority): 12. Unit & integration tests 13. Audit logging 
14. Pagination 15. Security headers 16. Performance monitoring
"In summary, while the current implementation has solid foundations, production 
requires robust logging, monitoring, rate limiting, caching, versioning, and 
proper secrets management. These additions ensure reliability, security, 
scalability, and maintainability in a production environment."
