Java script basics :
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
------------------
JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";

-------------
The <script> Tag
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
---------------
script can be place in body, or head.
fucntion, events are the key

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the 
src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
<script src="myScript.js"></script>

------------------
JavaScript is Case Sensitive

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly."

variable declaration:
Modern JavaScript
Using let
Using const
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
let x = "5" + 2 + 3; it treats as string
--------------------
Block Scope
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

{
  let x = 2;
}
............
global scope:
Example
Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

{
  var x = 2;
}-
------------
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
-----------------
string tremplate :
${expression}.
instead writing this 
let greeting = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
you can write 
let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

Objects
How to Create a JavaScript Object
An object literal is a concise way to create an object.

An object literal is a list of key : value pairs inside curly braces { }:

const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}
