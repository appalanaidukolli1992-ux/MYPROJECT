🧩 PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Functional Analyst  – IKEA SCD - GS1 (via TCS)
Duration: 8.5 years
Location: IOS Almhult

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:

Subject Matter Expert – Range & Supply:
Led functional and analytical initiatives across IKEA's supply chain, with a sharp focus on planning, traceability, and product compliance. Partnered with business and IT stakeholders to shape and deliver scalable solutions.
-I’ve consistently translated executive vision into detailed technical roadmaps, aligning cross-functional teams and ensuring fluid communication between stakeholders and engineering
-I love connecting with people to understand their goals, spotting ways we can do things better, and helping the team build smart solutions—always keeping the backlog clear and purposeful
-In my current role, I actively stay on top of new GS1 releases, making sure our processes and capabilities evolve in line with emerging standards and competencies. It’s part of my day-to-day to connect these updates to real business needs—driving alignment, improvement, and readiness for future opportunities
--While working as an SLA Lead in the PRM area, I had the opportunity to lead and support a 7-member team—focusing not just on hitting targets, but on helping each person grow through ongoing coaching, shared learning, and a strong commitment to end-user support
- As a GS1 Functional Analyst, I’ve have a holistic understanding of how IKEA’s supply chain operates—how different products, processes, and business units interconnect. 
This is exactly how I approach implementing GS1 standards or suggesting compliance changes—by combining in-depth knowledge of their impact with a clear understanding of the connected business areas. Without this cross-functional insight, it wouldn’t be possible to make meaningful, aligned decision
