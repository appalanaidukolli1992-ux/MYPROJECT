Insurance Fundamentals.
-----
insurance is defined as a legally binding contract (an insurance policy) between 
two parties: the insurer (insurance company) and the insured (policyholder

 It serves as a form of risk management where an individual or business transfers 
the potential financial burden of uncertain future losses to the insurer in 
exchange for a fee called a premium.

Core Components
Insurer (Provider): The company that evaluates risks, collects premiums, and is 
responsible for providing financial coverage if a covered event occurs.

Insured (Policyholder): The entity covered by the policy who pays a relatively 
small, known cost (premium) to avoid a potentially large, unknown financial loss.

Premium: The amount paid periodically (monthly, annually) to maintain the 
insurance coverage.

Claim: A formal request made by the insured to the insurer for compensation when 
a covered loss happens.

Deductible: The out-of-pocket amount the policyholder must pay before the 
insurance company pays for a claim

 Q9. What role does a Business Analyst play in insurance flow?

Answer:
A BA translates insurance business rules into system requirements, defines 
workflows, validation rules, exception handling, and supports UAT with real-world 
scenarios.
----------
Q10. What is the difference between coverage and sum insured?

Answer:
Coverage defines what risks are insured, while sum insured defines how much the 
insurer will pay.
------------------------------------------------
Risk Awareness

Definition:
Understanding potential events that may cause financial or operational loss to 
an individual or organization.
-----
Risk Assessment
techinques:
“In insurance, risk assessment is done using historical data analysis, actuarial 
models, probability–impact matrices, scenario analysis, and fraud scoring 
techniques. These methods help insurers evaluate underwriting, claims, 
operational, and regulatory risks and apply appropriate controls.

Definition:
The systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to 
determine their likelihood and impact.

Example:
An insurer assesses accident frequency and repair costs before offering motor 
insurance.
-------------------------
2. Process of Evaluating Risk (Risk Evaluation)
Step 1: Risk Identification-Recognizing potential loss-causing events.
Step 2: Risk Analysis-Measuring the probability and severity of the identified 
risk.
Step 3: Risk Evaluation-Deciding whether the risk is acceptable, transferable, 
or needs control.
----------------
3. Tools Used for Risk Evaluation
Loss History Data -Past claim records used to predict future risk
Risk Surveys -Physical inspection of assets
Statistical Models
Checklists
---------------------
RISK :
uncertainty of the occurrence of an event that results in financial, physical, or 
reputational loss.
There is uncertainty whether a car accident will occur and how costly it will be.
5. Five Types of Risk Attitudes
risk avoider,risk  reducer, risk  retainer,risk sharer,risk taker
--------------------
types of risks:
Insurance risks include underwriting, claims, fraud, operational, financial, 
regulatory, reputational, strategic, market, catastrophic, and technology risks, 
each impacting profitability, compliance, and customer trust
Risk Management (RM)
Definition

Risk Management is the process of identifying, analyzing, controlling, and 
financing risks to minimize losses.

A company insures its assets and installs fire alarms.

End-to-End Claims Lifecycle
1. Intake: First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
The process begins when a policyholder reports an incident. In 2026, this is 
increasingly done through digital FNOL channels like mobile apps, chatbots, or 
self-service portals rather than traditional phone calls. 
BA Focus: Ensure the system captures critical data (date, time, location, 
photos/videos) and validates policy details "on the fly" to reduce manual 
re-keying. 
2. Triage & Assignment
Once submitted, a workflow engine routes the claim based on predefined business 
rules. Simple claims (like a windshield repair) may trigger Straight-Through 
Processing (STP), while complex ones are assigned to a human adjuster based on 
expertise or location. 
BA Focus: Document the logic for "Segmentation & Assignment" to ensure claims go 
to the right department. 
3. Verification & Adjudication
The insurer verifies if the loss is covered under the active policy. 
Policy Review: Checking deductibles, coverage limits, and exclusions.
Fraud Detection: In 2026, AI-powered tools automatically flag "red flags" (e.g., 
suspicious timing, inconsistent statements).
Reserving: The system sets aside a "Claim Reserve"—estimated funds to cover the 
future payout. 
4. Investigation & Evaluation
An adjuster investigates to determine the amount of loss. 
Damage Assessment: May involve virtual appraisals, where photos/videos are 
analyzed by AI or external experts (engineers/contractors).
Liability: Identifying at-fault parties and witness information. 
5. Settlement & Payment
Once the claim is approved, the final settlement amount is calculated based on 
policy coverage minus any applicable deductibles. 
Payout: Payment is issued via digital channels to the policyholder or a preferred 
vendor (repair shop).
BA Focus: Tracking "Claim Settlement Cycle Time" to ensure the insurer meets 
agreed-upon timelines. 
6. Recovery & Closure
If a third party was at fault, the insurer may initiate Subrogation to recover 
costs from that party's insurer. Once all payments and recoveries are complete, 
the claim is officially closed in the system. 
-------------

Subrogation: If someone else caused the accident, your insurer asks their insurer 
to pay them back.

 Beneficiary is the individual (often in life insurance) who receives the payout 
when a claim occurs, with roles sometimes overlapping but often distinct.

Risk Management Techniques? in insurance domain
In insurance, risk management involves identifying, assessing, controlling, 
financing, and monitoring potential threats to capital and earnings, using 
techniques like avoidance, reduction (mitigation), transfer (reinsurance), 
retention, and sharing, enhanced by modeling, data analytics, diversification, 
and technology (AI, RPA) for accurate pricing, fraud detection, and regulatory 
compliance
------------------------
Key Techniques & Strategies
Avoidance: Not engaging in risky activities (e.g., refusing to underwrite certain 
high-risk policies).
Reduction/Loss Prevention: Implementing measures to lower frequency/severity 
(e.g., safety programs, better underwriting).
Transfer: Shifting risk to others, primarily through Reinsurance (insuring the 
insurers) or specific policies (cyber insurance).
Retention: Accepting and funding smaller, predictable losses (self-insurance, 
reserves).
Sharing: Spreading risk among many policyholders (diversification) or partners.
Diversification: Spreading investments and insured risks across various sectors 
to lessen volatility.

Technology revolutionizes insurance by using AI, IoT, and data analytics for 
hyper-personalized pricing, faster claims (fraud detection), better risk 
assessment (telematics), streamlined operations, and new distribution via mobile, 
creating more efficient, customer-centric, and data-driven insurance models, 
known as InsurTech, from underwriting to payouts.
