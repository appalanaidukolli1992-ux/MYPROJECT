2. Why IKEA / Why Inter IKEA? — Composed Answer

1 impression, 1st love, 1st company
I began my career at IKEA and have worked across INGKA and Inter IKEA in 
different teams. Over the past four years in Älmhult, the heart of IKEA, I gained 
a holistic view of how IKEA operates business across the value chain. I strongly 
connect with IKEA’s purpose, values, and long-term commitment to creating a 
better everyday life for the many people.
function, form, quality, sustainability, and low price

I have always admired how IKEA supports communities globally—encouraging 
small-scale manufacturers, creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged 
groups, and driving positive social and environmental impact through initiatives 
like IKEA Foundation. Seeing how these values are applied in real ways, not just 
on paper, made me feel genuinely proud to work here.

What inspires me most is IKEA’s focus on democratic design—offering quality, 
well-designed products at an affordable price—not driven by maximizing profit but 
by maximizing value for customers and society. This aligns closely with my own 
principles.

Professionally, the role at Inter IKEA matches the work I have been doing: 
database development, data analysis, DevOps, C#/.NET development, production 
support, and leading teams—both on-site and from India. I understand IKEA’s 
systems, data flows, integrations, and ways of working deeply.

I have a strong and genuine interest to continue growing within IKEA and 
contributing to solutions that support the global range, supply, and product 
information landscape. This is why I applied for this role.

2. Experieicne : Db developer 
I have been working with IKEA for about nine years across both INGKA and Inter 
IKEA as a consultant.
For the first six years, I worked in INGKA as a DevOps Engineer and AMS Lead, 
taking full end-to-end ownership of core Range business applications. My 
responsibilities included development, production support, testing, release 
coordination, infrastructure management, and database migrations. I worked across 
multiple areas such as Product Range Management and Product Communication, 
ensuring stability, performance, and continuous improvement of the applications 
and their databases.

After that, I moved into Inter IKEA, in the Supply/GS1 team, where I worked as a 
Database Developer and Analyst. My role focused on designing and developing 
database solutions for data-mapping POCs, optimizing SQL logic, and integrating 
GS1 standards into IKEA product master data. I worked closely with business teams 
to understand data properties, run case-study investigations, and create 
standardized data models that can be consumed by digital platforms like OFP and 
the Trade Item Hub.

Because of this combined experience, I have strong hands-on expertise in Oracle, 
PostgreSQL, PL/SQL, performance tuning, and C#. I also have a deep understanding 
of IKEA’s architecture, integrations, and data flows, which helps me contribute 
effectively from day one
