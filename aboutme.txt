Hi, my name is Appala Naidu Kolli, but most people call me Bobby.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.
I come from a small village in South India and completed my Master’s degree in Computer Applications in 2016. Shortly after, I joined TCS, 
and IKEA has been my first and longest-running project—it's been nearly 9 years now.
I began my career as a Support Analyst in the AMS team for IKEA Product Communication (PC), working across areas like media, translations, 
labels, range management, ToCompete, and RDC. Later, I transitioned to Product Range Management (PRM), supporting PIA and its family of applications. 
After the AMS team ramped down, I took on a Lean Analyst role, acting as an SME and coach for the DevOps teams handling AMS operations.
For the past 2 years, I’ve been part of the GS1 team, working as a Business Analyst and Data Analyst. My focus has been on integrating
 GS1 standards into IKEA’s digital ecosystem—leading case studies on GTIN assignment in PLM, packaging hierarchy, GDSN data models for IMD,
 product data standardization via OFP, Trade Item Hub, and classification through GOC.
I’m passionate about building scalable, standards-driven solutions that align with IKEA’s business goals and values. 
I look forward to contributing further in a Solution Architect role.
