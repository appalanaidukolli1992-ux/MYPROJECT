explain about what tyes of authentications autherization you used in u r application

2.oauth how does it work

3. how can ensure qulity and securuity of u r code_

4. can u write code for index creating

5. diff btn SP and funtion
.-----------------------------
6. Promises and observables
Use Task for API calls
Task

Represents one asynchronous operation

Produces a single result

Completes once

Used with async / await

Use Observable for events or streams
IObservable<T>

Represents a stream of values over time

Can emit multiple results

Push-based

Requires subscription

Here’s a concise interview-ready answer for “How do you handle session management 
in .NET Core”:

Answer:

"In ASP.NET Core, session management can be handled in multiple ways depending on 
the application type and scalability requirements.

Server-side sessions:

Use the built-in session middleware with IDistributedCache for storage.

Options include in-memory cache for single-server apps or Redis / SQL Server for 
distributed scenarios.

Session data is linked to the client via a secure cookie (.AspNetCore.Session).

Example: storing a user ID in session and retrieving it in controllers.

Token-based (stateless) approach:

For APIs or SPA apps, use JWT tokens.

The server does not maintain state; the client passes the token with each request.

Scalable and avoids server-side session storage.

ASP.NET Core Identity:

Provides cookie-based session management, authentication, and authorization 
out-of-the-box for MVC/Razor apps.

Best practices:

Set HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies.

Limit session timeout (IdleTimeout).

Avoid storing large objects; store only IDs and fetch data as needed.

Use distributed storage (Redis) for multi-server deployments.

Overall, for web apps, server-side session with Redis works well; for APIs/SPAs, 
JWT tokens are preferred for stateless scalability."

Here’s a concise interview-ready answer for “How do you handle state management 
in .NET/Core and web applications”:

Answer:

"State management is about tracking user or application data across multiple 
requests. Since HTTP is stateless, we need mechanisms to persist state.

Server-side state:

In ASP.NET Core, we can use Session middleware with in-memory or distributed 
cache (like Redis) to store user-specific data.

Example: storing user ID or shopping cart in session.

Client-side state:

For SPA apps like Angular, we use services, component state, or browser storage 
(LocalStorage, SessionStorage, cookies) to maintain temporary or persistent state.

Stateless token-based approach:

For APIs, JWT tokens carry user claims; the server does not store session state, 
making it scalable.

Best practices:

Minimize storing large objects; store only identifiers.

Use distributed cache for multi-server deployments.

Protect sensitive data with encryption.

Combine server and client state carefully for SPA + API architectures."
